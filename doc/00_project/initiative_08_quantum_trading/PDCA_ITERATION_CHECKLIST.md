# PLAN
- [x] task_plan exists and linked (`doc/00_project/initiative_08_quantum_trading/task_plan.md`)
- [x] deliverable acceptance criteria defined (`doc/00_project/initiative_08_quantum_trading/deliverable.md`)
- [x] risks enumerated with mitigations/rollback (`doc/00_project/initiative_08_quantum_trading/task_plan.md`)

# DO
- [x] implementation matches task_plan (no scope creep) (`doc/00_project/initiative_08_quantum_trading/task_plan.md`)
- [x] docs updated for impacted modules (`doc/00_project/initiative_08_quantum_trading/notes.md`)
- [x] PR references plan + deliverables (N/A: 本轮无 PR 上下文；以 deliverable+outputs 证据为准)

# CHECK
- [x] tests executed; key paths covered (`doc/00_project/initiative_08_quantum_trading/task_plan.md`)
- [x] evidence links filled in deliverable.md (`doc/00_project/initiative_08_quantum_trading/deliverable.md`)

# ACT
- [x] closeout completed (docs + skills + ledger) (`doc/00_project/initiative_08_quantum_trading/deliverable.md`)
- [x] three-end consistency checked (local/GitHub/production) or mark N/A with evidence (GitHub/VPS 缺少对照入口，按 N/A/Partial 留证据见 `doc/00_project/initiative_08_quantum_trading/deliverable.md`)

## Changelog
- 2026-02-11: initialized. (reason: planning-with-files)
- 2026-02-13: marked completed (reason: DoD satisfied; evidence in task_plan/deliverable/outputs).
